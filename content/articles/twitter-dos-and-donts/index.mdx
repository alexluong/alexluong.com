With the recent downfall of a certain character in the tech community — ahem John Sonmez — it seems like some of us may enjoy a reminder on how to act on Twitter.

I take it upon myself to create an illustrated guide on how to twitter.

If you're here wanting to gain fame and amass an impressive follower, this guide is not for you. I, myself, am still looking for such secret formula.

This is simply a guide on how to make friends and maybe (hopefully) influence people on Twitter.

**Disclaimer**: This post contains lots of _personal opinions_, _shameless plugs_, and _selfish call to action_. Proceed at your discretion.

## ⛔️ Don't: Be a bully

![somebody tweets "Shut your mouth"](./bully.png)

Don't do this. Bully bad 👎

## ✅ Do: Be supportive

![Nader Dabit tweets supportive stuff](./supportive.png)

Do this. Inclusion good 👍

## ✅ Do: Spread love

![Kent C. Dodds spreads love on his birthday](./love.png)

Nuff said.

## ⛔️ Don't: Spread hate

Okay I can't find a good example here, but don't do this, kids.

## ✅ Do: Be nice

Okay this may be a bit off-topic, but isn't this interaction just so wholesome? Let's all offer each others jobs and skip the 100 rounds whiteboard interviews with 20 take home exercises. Oh and since we're on this topic, I'm also looking for a job so someone, offer me a job too!!!! Gimme gimme.

## ⛔️ Don't: Be mean

![Somebody saying mean stuff](./mean.png)

I'm totally taking this out of context here. But no matter what the context is, it's inadvisable to call people dumb. Or make inappropriate remarks towards others.

## ✅ Do: Ask for help

## ✅ Do: Offer help

![Karl Groves offers help](./offer-help.png)

## ⛔️ Don't: Jump to conclusion

![Somebody assumes Adam bad intention because he asks about things](./jump-to-conclusion.png)

Please don't assume that everybody has bad intention. It may be hard to convey intent via text sometimes. Instead, how about asking clarifying questions to understand others thoughts before ... attack them.

## ✅ Do: Have a civil discussion

## ⛔️ Don't: Make personal attack

## ⛔️ Don't: Harass people in their DM

![Somebody being harassed by creepy people](./harass.png)

Don't do this guys and gals.

Shameless plug: I made a Twitter bot that filters out these sort of messages. Anybody having this issue please holler at me thank you very much 😇

## ✅ Do: Be nice in DM

If you're to send somebody a private message, at the very least have the decency to be nice.

![Conversation of people being nice](./nice-dm.png)

That's me 😇

Another me:

## ✅ Do: Be helpful

Bonus:

## ✅ Do: Build bots

Let's build lots and lots of Twitter bots to enrich your and everyone else's experiences on this blue platform.

Another shameless plug: If you don't know how to build a Twitter bot, stay tuned for my comprehensive guide on how to create one. Coming later this week. I'm serious. Read my stuff. Please!!

These are just a few examples of accepted and unaccepted behaviors on Twitter, in my **personal** opinion.

Everything boils down to **use common sense** and **treat others how you'd like to be treated**. Basic elementary stuff, I know, but not everybody is following.

At the end of the day, you do you. I'm not your mother. I can't tell you what to do. So...

Happy tweeting!
